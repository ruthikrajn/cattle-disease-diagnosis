          <h2><span>Excellent Solution</span> For Cattle Disease and Treatment!!</h2>
          
          <p class="infopost"></p>


          <p>In real time it is difficult to handle the cattle disease symptoms and disease types as animals cant explain their problems or pain that they are facing.

In medical sector finding the cattle disease symptoms, diseases is a challenging task.
<br /><br />proposed system major objective is to find the cattle disease symptoms and then predicting the correlation between symptoms-diseases-treatments.</p>

<p>As in current system it is difficult to identify the cattle disease and also its difficult to give the proper treatments.</p>
<p>Proposed system uses data science technqiues to identify the cattle disease symptoms and to predict the patterns. </p>

<p>proposed system used "lesk based algorithm" to identify the symptoms and then it uses data science technique "apriori algorithm" to find the patterns.</p>

<p>System planned to build as real time application which is useful to doctors to handle the cattel disease.
