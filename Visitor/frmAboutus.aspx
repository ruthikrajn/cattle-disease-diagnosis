          <p>Manual process of identifying the cattle disease and treatment is too complex and time consuming and also expensive. These systems just collects the data, stores in database and retrieves the same in future, but no extraction of useful information which helps the medical practitioners to handle the cattle disease in a better way. </p>

          <p>In real time it is difficult to handle the cattle disease symptoms and disease types as animals cant explain their problems or pain that they are facing. In medical sector finding the cattle disease symptoms, diseases is a challenging task. Proposed system major objective is to find the cattle disease symptoms and then predicting the correlation between symptoms-diseases-treatments. As in current system it is difficult to identify the cattle disease and also its difficult to give the proper treatments.</p>
